- [ ] Make sure I get tires before HH.


if I add squared numbers, I find that more frequently that not, their result is odd.

One important thing to note is that if I purchase a bunch of groceries, certain items comprise meals, and because of this, only counting the items that would make one meal when doing division on the bill (e.g. 76.12/2 because I bought two steaks) is faulty logic if I also purchased 12 eggs and this can make 6 meals of pancakes. This means like while two meals are like 20, the remaining meals are like 5 and thus this balances. Another good approach is relating what I spend with the meal plan with school, and eating like this is well within these limits. One thing I could do better is budget for monthly delivery and make this consistent, though.

So, for my grocery bill for:

- 2 steaks,
- 2 things lemonade,
- butter,
- stroganoff,
- 12 eggs, & 
- 2 avocados

amounts to 10.4 each meal.


PROOF

Given we have a set of all non-negative integers, ζ
And we start an index at position 2 of ζ, as a variable named current_index (i.e. integer: 3 with zero-based indexing)
Then set each another variable prior_integer_index for the (current_index + current_index - 2)
And square ζ[current_index]
And square ζ[prior_integer_index]
And sum ζ[current_index] and ζ[prior_integer_index]
Then we have that the sum is even
And if we then sum ζ[current_index] αnd ζ[prior_integer_index]
Then we have that the sum is even
And we have that two non-negative integers whose sum of squares is even shall have an even non-squared sum.

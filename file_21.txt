Finding the cardinality of a union of sets:

1. If the set is super 0, then cardinality is 1, for the empty string
2. Beyond that, find the Cartesian product , where however  many multiplicative iterations is equal to super script of that step of the iteration of unions. 
3. I.e. n-art Cartesian Product #n-ary-cartesian-product

n-ary Cartesian Products can also map sets of functions through Cartesian products. this could conceptually include an exponent as a function, such that a Cartesian square was created. 

Ex:

B={0,1,2}

B^0 is 1
B^1 is 3
B^2 is 9

1+3+9=13

With equalities:

1. Identify both sides are equal
2. Identify the result of either side matches a pattern in some visual

With simplifying:

If log, inverse of log base
If log of something to some power,
  move that variable to left. 
Simplify like normal. 


With functions:

A #bijection is said to exist if:
1. Given two sets (Fig 1: (3, Clubs), (3, Spades), (4, Hearts), (3)), there exists some mapping from an identifier in the same position, with a like value in the next position to another tuple with the same value in one position with a like value in the other position â€” (ex: (3, Clubs), (3, Spades) not (4, Hearts) or (3, ___); in Fig. 1)).

Omitted

As to how things have changed things. I have completed my coursework that I set out to complete and I do attend one class per semester at  midnight to keep things sharp. 

I would like to work with an organization within healthcare so that I can apply some of these concepts that Iâ€™ve learned directly in the field of healthcare.

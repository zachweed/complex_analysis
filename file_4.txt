Yep a couple of things I found helpful for clarification in language:

A school, Harvard Extension School within Harvard University. 

Oxford defines one example of Extension as a category of schooling that is not full time. 

Additionally, Extension is an act of prolonging, continuation, increasing size of something. 

That is, part-time school increasing size of knowledge bank while continuing studies and education.

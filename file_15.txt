They are okay based on what you are looking for. In terms of content, it is there and high quality depending on what school it is (eg i have completed some coursework taught through TH Chan here with Harvard on edx in Data Science and R and found it high quality & challenging). Also there is benefit with graded assignments in certificate courses. My experience with the grading, when there are manual graders, is that the graders were quite involved. In my experience there is a difference in dimensionality with lectures; specifically, there are lectures where interpersonal dynamics (eg eye contact, body language, dynamic tone, etc) are not necessarily present, as it is one-sided, and in real-time interaction things flow differently. tldr: they are high quality with Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health specifically (through HarvardX) and I consider them complementary with formal coursework and self-study.

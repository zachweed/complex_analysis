Where Γ is rate of change (Δ) WRT underlying price, L δΓ/δσ is Color [gamma decay]) as derivative of Γ. 

That is: rate of change of gamma (Γ) over passing time. Where Color represents rate of decay of rate of change of some option. 

Naturally that is where Γ = δΔ/δS, where S is underlying price. In words, derivative of delta w.r.t. changes of an assets underlying price. 

That said, consistent Color indicates less volatility of Gamma and therefore more predictable results w.r.t. volatility in the market. 

Each of these stack as first, second, third order derivatives, all built upon theoretical changes of options of any kind in some market.
